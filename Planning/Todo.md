Todo / ideas:

Fixes:
- Y-Axis, typing is perpendicular
    - just cover the old text in white while typing
- Test / fix empty titles
    - Add padding
- Scale threshold for circle w/ graph size
- Scale circle + annotation w/ graph size
- Make code work with an empty graph


Future:
* Graph that can take a list of strings for X (or y)
    - Ex: Months
* Different graph supports
    - Pi, bar (col, row, radial), graph, line
* Allow multiple data sets
    - Multiple lines
* Easy import from clipboard / excel
* Change axes
* Change color
* Drag graph to move
* Export graph function
